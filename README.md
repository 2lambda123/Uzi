# Uzi
Uzi is an stunning Ransomeware due to its features.
This ransomeware works using AES encryption.
It is still in Beta phase. 
(Decryption Mechanism will be uploaded in a few days.)
I am still developing new modules to add to Uzi.

Some of them are::
- Creation of an encrypted ssh server for transfer of files to Host
- Custom Backdoor access
- Keylogger
- Using metasploit modules for post exploitation.
